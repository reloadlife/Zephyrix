# Zephyrix Development

This document outlines the comprehensive development roadmap for the Zephyrix backend web framework. Below is a list of features to be implemented over time, along with their current status.

## thigs that are working (implemented features)

> here is a list of things that are implemented, and working in the Zephyrix web framework.
> they're not fully tested or functonal, but they've been implemented and work fine.

- [x] Cobra CLI integration (globally)
- [x] Configuration Management using `viper`
- [x] Logger integration [`zephyrix.Logger`](zephyrix_logger.go#Logger) is usable and is of type [`zephyrix.ZephyrixLogger`](zephyrix_logger.go#ZephyrixLogger)
- [x] a working HTTP Server using `gin-gonic` as the underlying engine
- [x] Dependency Injection using [`fx`](https://github.com/uber-go/fx) as the underlying DI container. (might be replaced with [`wire`](https://github.com/google/wire) in the future)
- [x] Beeorm implementation for ORM and database management (Should be replaced with a custom ORM in the future)
- [x] Dependency Injected Router / Route Manager
- [ ]
